# Garbage Classification Project

## Project Overview
This project aims to classify different types of garbage using machine learning techniques. It involves data loading, visualization, feature selection, and the implementation of classification models.

## Dataset
**Dataset:** [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mainbt/garbage-dataset-1]  
**Description:** Provide a brief description of the dataset, including its contents, source, and any relevant information. Mention the number of classes, the type of data (e.g., images, text), and any preprocessing already performed on the data.

## Data Preprocessing
### Data Loading
- Load the dataset into a suitable data structure, such as a Pandas DataFrame.
  
### Data Cleaning
- Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies as necessary.

### Feature Engineering
- Create new features or transform existing ones if needed to improve model performance.

## Data Visualization
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualize the distribution of classes, image dimensions, and other relevant features to gain insights into the data.
  
### Use of Libraries
- Utilize libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn for creating informative plots.


## Feature Selection
### Methods
- Implement feature selection techniques such as SelectKBest and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to identify the most informative features.

### Rationale
- Explain the rationale behind choosing these methods and the criteria used for feature selection.

## Classification Models
### Model Selection
- Choose appropriate classification algorithms based on the nature of the problem and dataset (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest).

### Model Training
- Train the selected models on the preprocessed data.

### Model Evaluation
- Evaluate the performance of the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Results and Analysis
### Performance Comparison
- Compare the performance of different models and discuss the impact of feature selection.

### Insights
- Analyze the results to gain insights into the factors influencing garbage classification accuracy.
